            <h2>What is SpriteFoundry?</h2>
            <p>It’s an online tool built to help game developers to create simple
                sprite sheets for theirs games, it has some basic drawing functions
                like brush, eraser, fill bucket and others.There are also tools to
                export an spritesheet image and watch an animation preview.</p>

            <h2>Browser supports</h2>
            <p>SpriteFoundry has been tested on the newer Firefox and Chrome, but it
                should work on Opera and Safari as well, although we don’t support
                IE due its lack of HTML5 features.</p>

            <h2>Save your spritesheets</h2>
            <p>We use integrated Google Account authentication in order to relate
